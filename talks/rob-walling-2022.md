Some of these tactics may feel familiar, some stuff you're already doing, and hopefully some will be new helpful tactics.

[50 Tactical Tips for Running a low stress SaaS](/marc-tobias-metten) is a related talk for more listacle-style tips.

1. **Qualify and route demos automatically**: when you have an abundance of inbound demo requests it's useful to ask a qualifying question to see if they're worth your time to schedule a demo. If not, send them to a prerecorded demo.
2. **Monitor your sending IPs & Domains**: do a blacklist check on [MxToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx) for your email domain and IP to check if your email has been blacklisted and set up an email alert to continue checking it.
3. **Encourage annual upgrades at the right time**: annual plans are great because you get cash up front. You want to pitch it to people after signup. The best time to pitch a switch to annual is the inflection point of churn after most people that will churn already have.

> Hello [first name],
> I wanted to let you know about a way to get 2 months of **product name** for free. If you upgrade to our annual plan, you'llr eceive 12 months for the price of 10 (so you'll pay X for the year instead of Y).

4. **Help yourself by helping a B2B writer**: [HARO](https://www.helpareporter.com/) connects journalists with content experts but takes a lot of work. Rob has submitted 50 pitches and only gotten 3-4 links. [Help a B2B writer](https://helpab2bwriter.com/) is more niche so higher signal:noise.
5. **Consider a Google Analytics Alternative**: Google Analytics is probably on its way out for GDPR compliance so sign up for something else now so when you _have_ to switch over you have some history. [Fathom](https://www.fathomhq.com/) is a good one that include uptime monitoring and [Heap](https://heap.io)
6. **Redirect domain.com/meeting** to your scheduling link as a 302 temporary on [SavvyCal](https://savvycal.com/) or [Calendly](https://calendly.com/).
7. **Keep a marketing changelog** so you can debug business problems like leads going down.

8. **[F5bot](https://f5bot.com/) + Google Alerts**: google alerts are delayed ~12 hours. [F5bot](https://f5bot.com/) is free and scans Reddit, Hacker News, and Lobsters.
9. **Segment your Churn by Price** to get insights into who your best customers are. Your total churn doesn't really matter.
10. **Drop your lowest plan**. More on this from [Rob's 2021 Microconf Europe talk](/rob-walling-2021).
11. Make an ask after a successful support ticket
12. **Install [Microsoft Clarity](https://clarity.microsoft.com/)** for heatmap tracking.
13. **Enable [S3 Versioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Versioning.html)** and you'll have insurance against deleting customer files.
14. **Use Uptime Monitoring** with something like [Speedway](https://www.speedway.app/) or [Fathom](https://www.fathomhq.com/).
15. **Track your knowledgebase searches**, especially ones that don't get results.
16. **Enable SPF/DKIM**: check that you have the correct configuration with an [SPF Record Checker](https://www.dmarcanalyzer.com/spf/checker/).
17. **Rate limit your APIs**: every framework has a rate limiter (ex: [flask_limiter](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-Limiter/), [django_ratelimit](https://django-ratelimit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [ruby_limiter](https://github.com/Shopify/limiter), [RateLimiter](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/rate-limiting))
18. **Ask why people are canceling**: instead of a text box at cancel that people will ignore, send an email.

![An example email asking why someone canceled](https://res.cloudinary.com/genco/image/upload/w_1200/v1649109987/c/g7Yk.jpg)

19. **Use "my" text expanders**: start with `myadd` for your address, `mycal` for your savvycal link, and `myzoom` for your zoom link. If you have an Apple device you can do this once and have the expanders across your devices.
20. **Have an email label for lower priority tasks**: batch process them once a week.
21. **Upgrade to the Audible Annual Plan** to reduce your price per book to like $9.
22. **Consider async voice**: 3-5 minute voice texts with something like [Loom](https://www.loom.com/) or [voxer](https://www.voxer.com/) can save a meeting.
23. **Speed up online videos** with something like [video speed controller](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk) or [video speed manager](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-manager/fkopaaikpmfhpmoobnmklgmcgmhgfkcd).
24. **Use team password management** with something like [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/).
25. **Use an email alias for every SaaS account you sign up for** like `accounts@domain.com` that multiple people can access.
26. **Use [privacy.com](https://privacy.com/) for spending management**: it abstracts your credit card into virtual numbers you can use for each service you use.
27. **Keep a "manual updates" list**: some things can't be automated with software. Keep track of things that need to be manually updated in one central place.
28. **Add a quarterly calendar event to review credit card transactions**: if it's not on the calendar you won't do it.
29. **Push live chat and email support into slack** with something like [Chatlio](https://chatlio.com/) or [AcornChat](https://acornchat.com/).
30. **Send a monthly advisor email** with high level metrics (MRR, new customers, new trials, revenue churn, total customers, and number of demos) and wins, losses, and plans

31. **Have a tradition**
