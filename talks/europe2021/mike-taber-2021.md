Mike left [Startups for the Rest of Us](https://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/) several months ago and now comes back on to chat about his SaaS, [Bluetick](https://bluetick.io/). On their last podcast episode in November, Mike chatted about merging with a company about 10x larger.

Mike was looking to merge primariliy to get a business partner. It seemed like there were many complimentary elements to the merger, but the deal fell through.

One of the reasos it didn't work is that Mike's potential partner's technical stack was a mess. Mike volunteered to take over as CTO for the other company because that product needed to work for the merger with Bluetick to work. The technical problems the business was having were simlar to problems Mike had already solved, so Mike agreed to work below market rate for a few months.
