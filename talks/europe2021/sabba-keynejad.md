Sabba grew Veed.io from nothing to £5M ARR in under two years and they're now at £6M ARR with no signs of slowing down.

His career path projected ten years out might have earned him a million a year, but even making a million a year wouldn't feel like enough after taxes and living expenses.

His early entrepreneurship wins included RealRedCups (making £500 per month).

Sabba was successful but unfocused. He was doing dev work, design, youtube videos, VR, Arduino stuff, and music. Nothing was particularly good.

> How can i combine creativity and entrepreneurship ?
> What can i do really well and what do i want to spend my time doing? How can I spend more of my time doing what I love? making music, Videos, Dev, Design and Film
> PLAN:
> Work less charge more.
> Put more effort into less projects.
> Focus more on fewer projects and make them the best they can be.

Sabba noticed that most of his film editing work was adding text to videos, so he sketched up a simple app, piled up all his cash and 2017 Bitcoin, and hired some junior developers. They were winning pitch competitions but rapidly losing money. After they ran out Sabba and his cofounder got contracting jobs for the next 8 months.

They were still developing Veed at the time and traffic started to pick up, so they quit their jobs again and applied to YC. They were rejected on the basis that they didn't yet have paid users, so they decided to start charging. Within the week they had several paying customers!

The first million took 12 months and the second million came only four months later. They're now at a team of 50 or 60.

## Tips to getting to £5M ARR

**Start niche in a big market.** Adobe is valued at $300B, Vimeo is valued at $5B just by being a video platform. Veed started in this big market focused on trimming video.

If you're trying to get into the meditation space, try focusing on just morning meditations.

**Every product has an acquisition channel.** Look at the acquisition channels your competitors use and use them.

**Make something people search for** instead of just something people want. If people are searching for it, there's verified demand and a way to get your thing in their hands.

**Don't be a developer**. Sabba wanted to grow the company as quickly as possible which meant focusing only on things that grew the product. Don't just build more features: answer questions on quora, publish youtube videos, write blog posts, and join user groups. Listen to podcasts from the heads of growth of big companies. When you're making enough money to not worry about growth you can think about the product.

**It takes longer than you think** to get a high MRR. It took a year and a half of development before Veed made a dollar.

**Care about what you and work with amazing people**. Make sure you have market-founder fit in what you're working on.

## Questions

**How do you keep your competitors at bay?**

We stay focused on the product. Having competitors is great because it means there's money! Our competitors didn't focus as much on growth.

**How are your prices so low?**

There are hundreds of millions of searches for video editing per month.

Sabba had an open offer for users that signed up that they could book a call with him for a personal tutorial. He was able to build a really clear picture of how

**What does your growth team look like?**

It's 10-20 people. The head of growth at Canva recommended . VAs are researching topics, then writers are putting articles together. They've also got three YouTubers making tutorials.
