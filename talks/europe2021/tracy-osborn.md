Tracy's goal in this talk is to help you feel more comfortable with visual design.

## 1. Visual Design Shortcuts

The fastest way for better looking designs is to cut down on clutter.

![Don't have a cluttered site](https://res.cloudinary.com/genco/image/upload/v1633438402/c/ose9.jpg)

Use a grid (ex: with Bootstrap or CSS grid) to give a sense of cohesiveness and help reduce clutter.

![Aligning a login form to a grid helps reduce clutter](https://res.cloudinary.com/genco/image/upload/v1633438472/c/23hk.jpg)

Pick a simple color palete and stick to it. Check out [A Simple Web Developer’s Color Guide](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/04/web-developer-guide-color/) for the theory and cheat by generating a simple color palete with something like colormind.io.

Don't use more than two fonts and don't use crazy fonts. Instead of using different fonts, try playing with font weight, italic, underline, and size.

Try giving your designs ample whitespace.

If you just aim for a clean design it will take you most of the way through the design changes we made here.

## 2. How to train your design intuition

Make a habit of looking for design elements you like and dislike on pages. [Savvycal](https://savvycal.com/) and [RightMessage](https://rightmessage.com/) are good examples of uncluttered design.

Don't be afraid of taking design ideas from sites you like. When Tracy made the cover for [Hello Web App](https://hellowebbooks.com/learn-django/) she drew heavy inspiration from another series on design.

## 3. Live design reviews

### [Upscaler](https://www.upscaler.io/)

![Upscaler's home page above the fold](https://res.cloudinary.com/genco/image/upload/v1633439369/c/beCM.png)

- this is a great clean design!
- movement is easy to overdo, which can make it distracting. This site uses a subtle animated background which makes it more visually interesting
- lots of great whitespace!
- nice subtle background behind the "Book a Demo" button—it communicates that this is important

![Upscaler's home page just below the fold](https://res.cloudinary.com/genco/image/upload/v1633439510/c/bqCG.png)

- this is a great example of blocks of content having only a few blocks per line
- great decisions on font and boldness

![Upscaler's third block of content](https://res.cloudinary.com/genco/image/upload/v1633439590/c/c8Ji.png)

- it's tempting to have grayish low-contrast content on a dark background. Keep an eye on keeping your contrast high enough

![Upscaler's animated menu](https://res.cloudinary.com/genco/image/upload/v1633439940/c/UVnD.gif)

- this is too much movement and the content flashes. Remove this animation

![Upscaler's fifth block of content](https://res.cloudinary.com/genco/image/upload/v1633439779/c/WmYH.png)

- the line here directs the reader's eye to blocks 1, 2, 3, and then 6, 5, 4.

### [DebugBear](https://www.debugbear.com/)

![DebugBear's testimonials](https://res.cloudinary.com/genco/image/upload/v1633439957/c/Piw9.png)

- excellent example of testimonials!

![DebugBear's below the fold content](https://res.cloudinary.com/genco/image/upload/v1633440048/c/rB4G.png)

- raise the font size here to increase readability
- the flow of image and text is good to keep the eye flowing

### Remy's site

- When I read the headline at the top, I'm not seeing a reason _why_ I should join. What benefit would I get being a customer that I wouldn't get by just clicking on the videos below?

- you could use this area to push users to

### [Routine Factory](https://routinefactory.com/)

![Routine Factory's homepage](https://res.cloudinary.com/genco/image/upload/v1633440289/c/JQR4.png)

- good example of illustrations! They're like stock photography but they don't feel like stock photography
- The top menu items are a little too close together
- "login" looks misplaced. It's contrasted too strongly. Try using that blue color for the "Get started for free" button and making the "login" button green

![Routine Factory's below-the-fold cotent](https://res.cloudinary.com/genco/image/upload/v1633440369/c/oBA1.png)

- the text is bordering on too small
- try making a more distinct difference between action items and content by making the links buttons
