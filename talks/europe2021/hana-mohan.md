The decision to bootstrap or get funding is so personal that it's difficult to give advice. Instead of a prescriptive talk on what _you_ should do, this is a record of Hana's journey through two bootstrapped businesses and one that was venture funded.

## Muziboo

Hana started Muziboo in 2007. It was like flickr for indy music sharing. Her expenses living in India were only $500/month so she was easily able to meet her goal of supporting herself from her business. At it's peak Muziboo made about $3k per month.

Hana grew frustrated that there wasn't a clear way to grow the business.

## SupportBee

Raising money was still difficult when Hana moved to her next venture. You had to have connections just to meet with an investor, it wasn't clear how to close deals, and the deals were bad and tedious.

Hana got accepted into YC2020 and was amazed how easy and favorable it was to raise more money. AirBnB raised their initial round at a 3M valuation and the new standard is 10M.

> People think that raising money is all fluff. It's a lot of fluff but it's not all fluff.

It's important to understand the lifecycle of investing from the investor's perspective. They don't necessarily care that their money will let you make another hire. Investors want a clear path to an exit.

Building companies is expensive because good people cost a lot and it's expensive to acquire and keep customers.

You can stay cash efficient without being bootstrapped.

SaaS costs are frontloaded. It takes a lot of effort to get it started butâ€”like a flywheelâ€”once they get going to keep their momentum. It's better to invest more up front and then recover the cost on the backend.

Bootstrapping can feel very isolating because there aren't many people (outside your family) who are invested in your success. Getting funding increases the size and strength of your support system. You can accomplish something similar by sending a newsletter to your friends, joining a mastermind or community, or hiring a coach.

If you build your business with the assumption that you'll eventually grow it

If you're growing your business, every six months you'll have a new job.
