At 29 years old Jeppe has tried many methods of self improvement, including trauma therapy and horse therapy. He felt like he knew himself and how to avoid stress.

Despite this self awareness, Jeppe found himself building resentment towards his wife and children. He would get trapped in self reinforcing positive feedback loops trying to justify why he wasn't helping his wife with things like caring for their baby in the middle of the night. Instead of feeding his desire to help, he tried to justify how he didn't need to help, which led to a distorted worldview that he wasn't being recognized by his wife.

> Self justifying thoughts are a good indication that your worldview is distorted.

To free yourself from distorted worldviews, pay attention to how you feel.
