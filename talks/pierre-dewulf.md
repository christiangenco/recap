- How Pierre and his business partner Kevin built their third company to $1m ARR in 2 years

Pierre and his business partner Kevin have built 3 products in the last 5 years, but it wasn't until their last product that they built a successful business.

Their first product, ShopToList, was a chrome plugin they built in 2017 that let you track product prices. Pierre and his business partner noticed that people were using it to track their competitors' prices.

Noticing there might be some marketing there, they quit their jobs to pivot to PricingBot in 2018. They assumed merchants would pay for this because there were merchants using ShopToList to solve a similar problem. After the first month they had 200 user signups but only one customer. They had an accurate insight (that merchants like tracking prices) but didn't talk to users enough to validate this was a problem they'd pay for.

<!-- (2018-2019, $450 MRR) -->

In the first month of ScrapingBee they focused on a more narrow audience: the web scraping community. They had less traffic and only 50 signups, but because the audience was more narrow they were able to get 3 customers much sooner than with PricingBot.

Pierre and his partner tried to optimize

From The Mom Test, ask:

- <strike>Do you think it's a good idea?</strike> => why do you care?
- <strike>How much would you pay for X?</strike> => talk me through your workflow
- <strike>Would you buy a product which did X?</strike> => what else have you tried?

Pay special attention to responses that sound like:

- 'solving this would save us Y hours per week'
- 'I'm currently paying X for this and don't like it' (ex: "I'm paying $5,000 for web scraping but I'm not happy with it")
- 'we've built some in-house tools'

That's an indication that there's a valuable problem to solve there.

## How do you decide what to build next?

To get clues on what features your users want next, try writing a table of contents in your documentation and adding features you're thinking of adding. You can run some wild experiments here with minimal cost.

Use Hotjar or Microsoft Clarity to gauge user interest on features. These tools let you filter data by people who already have an account or who spend a minimum amount of time This isn't foolproof, but it's a reasonable proxy to gauge feature interest.

## Don't push too hard on marketing

If you feel like you're dragging your users through the mud to convert, the problem is probably your product. Watch out for responses like:

> If you could add this feature we would totally pay for this

> Impressive. I'll take a look and reach out in a few days

> Yeah, this product is awesome, we'd love to use it, let me get back to you in a few weeks.

Pieree and his business partner noticed that they could sell $400 subscriptions with just a 10 minute conversation with ScrapingBee. With PricingBot they were sending dozens of emails and not getting a sale.

## Don't get lost in acquisition channels

With PricingBot Pierre and his business partner pivoted their marketing from SEO to affiliate sales to cold outreach to social marketing but each was frustratingly fruitless.

When marketing ScrapingBee, they just kept improving and interating on a single acquisition channel: SEO. This helped them push past the early phase of marketing where the results aren't noticable. Putting in the repetitions beats picking the perfect strategy.

To pick content to write about they started by using the skyscraper technique (writing high quality well researched overview articles). After 3-4 months they watched ahrefs' [Blogging for Business](https://ahrefs.com/academy/blogging-for-business) course which helped them dig up other topics to write about.

<!-- ## Don't believe in silver bullets -->

## Consistency isn't enough

If you're consistent at doing the wrong thing, you'll fail. The difficulty is figuring out in the early stages if something is working or not, because the efficacy of strategies looks almost identical at first.

![It's only after some time that you can tell the difference between strategies that work and don't work](https://res.cloudinary.com/genco/image/upload/v1633336842/c/sgsh.jpg)

Telling the difference is tricky.

## Quit too soon rather than too late

The only true validation is a paying customer, everything else is just fluff.

Now that ScrapingBee is mature, they don't let anyone schedule a call. To still stay in contact with high value , they pre-screen customers with an onboarding survey and invite high-use customers to a call.
