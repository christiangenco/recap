You'll learn:

- Why Laura fired her entire staff at MeetEdgar at the same time, even though the business was making millions annually
- How Laura made MeetEdgar 7x more profitable overnight

Laura launched MeetEdgar in 2014. She had aspirations to grow her team really big because that's what success felt like. Bringing people on meant adding employees that added more value than they cost. This is easy to do for sales roles but hard for engineers. How do you attribute revenue to individual employees?

MeetEdgar grew quickly: they hit $1M ARR 11 months after launch and more than doubled the next year. They grew up to 25 full-time in-house people even though their growth didn't continue at that rate. They hired too quickly, like hiring a full-time data analyst when they only had a handful of data analyst projects. Bringing more people on than the actual recurring work created busywork.

Approaching 2020 their growth was flat. Laura decided to invest all profits and PPP money into growth, including a project to add Pinterest support. At the end of 2020 their growth was still flat. It felt like something in the business wasn't making sense.

After reading business books that talked about the ideal ratio between employee expenses and revenue, Laura grew curious about what size of team would match a stable growth business.

At the end of 2020, MeetEdgar had the following positions working for a total of 1,840 hours per month:

- product
  - product owner/designer
  - 3 full time, 1 part time developer
  - 1 part time QA
- customer service team
  - 2 full time
  - 1 part time customer service rep
- marketing
  - marketing manager
  - freelance writers, designers
- operations
  - president
  - HR assistant
  - finance

The business wasn't profiting or growing and Laura was making 10%.

The amazing thing about software businesses are that people are paying for access to the software instead of human . Humans aren't necessarily necessary. Laura realized the only necessary employees for stable growth would be:

- product
  - 1 part time developer doing their own QA at 20 hours/week
- customer service team
  - 1 part time customer service rep at 10 hours/week
  - one backup customer service person
- marketing
  - small content agecy that updates the 500 blog post backlog
  - Laura spends 2 hours per week improving funnels
- operations
  - freelance bookkeeper that does the books monthly
  - freelance project manager at 10 hours/week to deal with random projects that come up

Now MeetEdgar runs on only 170 hours per month of human time (90% less than before), which bumped owner pay up to 70% and profit up to 60%. Their growth is still flat but the business is 7x more profitable.

Because Laura didn't wait until the financial situation was a disaster she was able to offer all employees 3 months severance to help them find their next thing.

What's the change in your business that feels really scary that you know you need to do?

## Questions

**Are you afraid your business will start shrinking by firing your product team?**

That's probably going to happen over time. I could either choose to be okay with that or to bring in more developers.

**Why not sell it?**

I think I will!

**How might you have avoided over-hiring?**

Hire freelance before bringing people on full time and wait to see if their role is indespensible.

**Why can't you grow?**

If I knew how to grow I'd be doing it! Hopefully whoever I sell to will have a playbook to grow bigger. One easy target might be more expansion revenue (adding higher plans so users can pay us more).

_Laura talks more about what might have impacted growth on her interview with Startups for the Rest of Us: [Stellar Growth, Platform Risk, Layoffs and Powering Through Roadblocks with Laura Roeder](https://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/episodes/episode-451-stellar-growth-platform-risk-layoffs-and-powering-through-roadblocks-with-laura-roeder)._

**When growing PaperBell, did you find yourself slipping into old habits?**

I'm doing a lot of the same things (because they worked) but approaching building the team differently. I'm doing a lot more of the marketing myself instead of hiring.

**How difficult was it for your employees afterwards?**

Surprisingly several employees were secretely hoping to be let go. There was really only employee that we had difficult followup conversations with.
